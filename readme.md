# SkillScanner: Towards Policy-Compliant Alexa Skills Development Through Static Analysis
## Abstract
In an effort to maintain the quality and trustworthiness of voice-apps (i.e., skills), Amazon Alexa has implemented a set of policy requirements to be adhered to by third-party skill developers. However, several recent works reveal the prevalence of policy-violating skills in the current skill store. To prevent the inflow of new policy-breaking skills to the skills stores from the source, it is critical to identify potential policy violations in skills by developers at the development phase. We address the policy-noncompliance problem in skills with SkillScanner, an efficient static code analysis tool to detect policy violations early in the skill development lifecycle. To evaluate the performance of SkillScanner, we conducted an empirical study on 1,870 open source skills collected from GitHub. SkillScanner effectively identified 1,100 different types of violations among these skills.
